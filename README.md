# Physically Based Renderer

This is a simple 3D physically based renderer written in C++ and OpenGL.
It implements the [Cook-Torrance BRDF microfacet model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_highlight#Cook%E2%80%93Torrance_model) to simulate the reflection of light on a surface.

TODO:
- add hot reload for shaders
- SSAO
- Shadows
- Deferred rendering
- Scene save/load 
- multiple lights and types
